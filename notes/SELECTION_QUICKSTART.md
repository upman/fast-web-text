# Text Selection Quick Start Guide

## What Was Implemented

Text selection now works in fast-web-text! You can:
- **Click and drag** with your mouse to select text
- **Shift+Click** to extend selection from cursor position
- **Shift+Arrow keys** to select text with keyboard
- See **visual selection highlights** (light blue background)

## How to Test

### Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### Test Mouse Selection
1. Click and hold mouse button on any text
2. Drag the mouse left/right or up/down
3. You should see blue highlight over selected text
4. Release mouse to finalize selection

### Test Shift+Click
1. Click to place cursor somewhere
2. Hold Shift and click somewhere else
3. Text between the two positions should be selected

### Test Keyboard Selection
1. Place cursor in text
2. Hold Shift and press Arrow keys (Up/Down/Left/Right)
3. Selection should expand in the direction you press
4. Try Shift+Home or Shift+End to select to line start/end

### Test Selection Clearing
1. Create a selection (any method)
2. Press an arrow key (without Shift)
3. Selection should clear
4. Or click anywhere (without Shift) to clear and move cursor

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `src/rendering/SelectionRenderer.ts` - Renders selection highlights
- `notes/SELECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed documentation

### Modified Files
- `src/input/InputHandler.ts` - Added mouse drag and Shift key handlers
- `src/core/Editor.ts` - Added selection methods and integrated SelectionRenderer
- `src/input/SelectionManager.ts` - (Already existed, no changes needed)

## Architecture Overview

```
User Mouse/Keyboard Input
        ↓
   InputHandler
        ↓
   Editor methods (startSelection, updateSelection)
        ↓
   SelectionManager (stores anchor & head positions)
        ↓
   SelectionRenderer (displays blue highlights)
```

## Known Limitations

1. **No Copy/Paste Yet**: Selection is visual only, no clipboard integration
2. **Typing Doesn't Replace**: Typing with selection active doesn't replace selected text
3. **No Word/Line Selection**: Double-click and triple-click not implemented
4. **Basic Rendering**: Simple rectangles, no rounded corners like VS Code

## Next Steps

If you want to enhance the selection feature:

1. **Add Copy/Paste**
   - Listen for Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V
   - Use navigator.clipboard API

2. **Replace Selected Text**
   - In `Editor.insertText()`, check if selection exists
   - Delete selected range before inserting new text

3. **Word/Line Selection**
   - Add double-click handler in InputHandler
   - Implement word boundary detection
   - Triple-click for full line selection

4. **Select All**
   - Add Ctrl+A handler
   - Select from start to end of document
